    "Questions": [
      {
        "Question": "What is a variable in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "A variable is a container that holds values. It allows you to store and manipulate data in a program."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What are the different data types in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "JavaScript has several primitive data types, including string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol. It also has a non-primitive data type called object."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is the difference between var, let, and const for variable declaration?",
        "Answer": "var was traditionally used for variable declaration in JavaScript. It has function scope and can be redeclared. let and const were introduced in ES6. They have block scope, and const is used for variables that should not be reassigned after initialization."
      },
      {
        "Question": "How do you declare and initialize a variable in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "You can declare a variable using var, let, or const, followed by the variable name. Initialization is the process of giving a variable its initial value. For example: 'let myVariable = 10;' declares and initializes a variable named 'myVariable' with a value of 10."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is a primitive data type?",
        "Answer": "A primitive data type is a type of data that represents a single value, not an object. Examples include string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is type coercion in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "Type coercion is the process of converting one data type to another. It can be implicit (automatic) or explicit (done manually by the programmer). For example, when adding a number and a string, JavaScript may implicitly convert the number to a string for concatenation."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is the typeof operator in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "The typeof operator is used to determine the data type of a value or expression. For example, 'typeof 42' will return 'number'."

      {
        "Question": "What are arithmetic operators in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "Arithmetic operators are used for performing mathematical calculations. Common arithmetic operators include + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), and % (modulo for finding the remainder)."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is the difference between == and === operators in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "== (loose equality) compares values after type coercion, while === (strict equality) compares both values and data types. === is generally preferred for avoiding unexpected type coercion issues."
      },
      {
        "Question": "Explain the ternary (conditional) operator in JavaScript.",
        "Answer": "The ternary operator (condition ? expr1 : expr2) is a shorthand for an if-else statement. If the condition is true, expr1 is executed; otherwise, expr2 is executed."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What are logical operators in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on values. Common logical operators include && (logical AND), || (logical OR), and ! (logical NOT)."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is the assignment operator in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. For example, 'x = 5;' assigns the value 5 to the variable x."
      },
      {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of operator precedence in JavaScript.",
        "Answer": "Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. For example, multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+). You can use parentheses to override precedence."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is the typeof operator used for with respect to variables and operators?",
        "Answer": "The typeof operator is used to determine the data type of a value or expression. For example, 'typeof 42' will return 'number'. It is often used to check the data type of a variable or the result of an operation."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is short-circuiting in logical operators?",
        "Answer": "Short-circuiting is a behavior of logical operators where the second operand is not evaluated if the outcome can be determined by only evaluating the first operand. For example, in '&&' if the first operand is false, the second operand is not evaluated because the result will always be false."

      {
        "Question": "Explain the 'if' statement and give an example.",
        "Answer": "The 'if' statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped. Example: \n\nif (condition) {\n  // Code to execute if condition is true\n}"
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is an 'else if' statement?",
        "Answer": "The 'else if' statement is used to specify a new condition if the first condition is false. It allows you to test multiple conditions and execute different code blocks accordingly."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is an 'else' statement?",
        "Answer": "The 'else' statement is used to specify the code block to execute if the condition in the 'if' statement is false. It is the default case when all other conditions are not met."
      },
      {
        "Question": "Explain the 'for' loop and give an example.",
        "Answer": "The 'for' loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It consists of an initialization, a condition, and an iteration. Example: \n\nfor (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n  // Code to execute in each iteration\n}"
      },
      {
        "Question": "Explain the 'while' loop and give an example.",
        "Answer": "The 'while' loop is used to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It only has a condition and does not have an explicit initialization or iteration. Example: \n\nwhile (condition) {\n  // Code to execute as long as condition is true\n}"
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is a 'switch' statement and when is it used?",
        "Answer": "A 'switch' statement is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed. It is often used when you have multiple cases to consider and want to avoid a series of 'if-else if' statements."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is the purpose of a 'break' statement in a loop or switch statement?",
        "Answer": "The 'break' statement is used to exit a loop or switch statement prematurely. It is often used to terminate a loop when a specific condition is met, or to prevent fall-through in a 'switch' statement."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is the difference between 'for' and 'while' loops?",
        "Answer": "'for' loops are typically used when you know the number of iterations in advance, and they have an explicit initialization, condition, and iteration. 'while' loops are used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and they only have a condition to check."

      },
      {
        "Question": "How do you define a function in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "You can define a function using the 'function' keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters enclosed in parentheses, and the function body enclosed in curly braces. For example: \n\nfunction myFunction(param1, param2) {\n  // Function body\n}"
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is a function parameter?",
        "Answer": "A function parameter is a variable that is listed as part of the function's definition. Parameters are placeholders for values that will be passed into the function when it is called."
      },
      {
        "Question": "How do you call (invoke) a function in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "You can call (invoke) a function by using its name followed by parentheses. For example: \n\nmyFunction(10, 20);"
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is a return value in a function?",
        "Answer": "A return value is the value that a function can send back to the code that called it. It is specified using the 'return' keyword in the function body. Functions may return a value or undefined if 'return' is not used."
      },
      {
        "Question": "Explain function scope in JavaScript.",
        "Answer": "JavaScript has function scope, which means that variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function. This concept is often referred to as local scope."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is a callback function?",
        "Answer": "A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of the parent function. Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous operations."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What are anonymous functions?",
        "Answer": "Anonymous functions, also known as function expressions, are functions without a name. They are often used as arguments to other functions or for defining functions inline."

      {
        "Question": "What is a self-invoking function (IIFE) in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "An IIFE is a function that is defined and immediately invoked. It is often used to create a private scope and prevent variable pollution in the global scope."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is the difference between 'function declaration' and 'function expression'?",
        "Answer": "Function declarations are hoisted in JavaScript, which means they can be used before they are declared in the code. Function expressions are not hoisted and can only be used after they are defined."

      },
      {
        "Question": "What are arrow functions in ES6?",
        "Answer": "Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions in ES6. They have a shorter syntax and do not bind their own 'this' value, which can be advantageous in certain situations."
      },
      {
        "Question": "Explain destructuring in ES6.",
        "Answer": "Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables with a more concise syntax. It simplifies the process of accessing and working with nested data structures."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What are template literals in ES6?",
        "Answer": "Template literals are string literals that allow you to embed expressions inside them using template placeholders (e.g., `${expression}`). They make it easier to create dynamic strings with variables and multiline strings."

      {
        "Question": "What is the difference between 'let' and 'const' for variable declaration in ES6?",
        "Answer": "'let' and 'const' are block-scoped variables introduced in ES6. 'let' allows variables to be reassigned, while 'const' creates variables that cannot be reassigned after they are initialized."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is the spread operator (...) in ES6?",
        "Answer": "The spread operator is used to spread the elements of an array or the properties of an object into another array or object. It is useful for creating copies, merging arrays, and simplifying function arguments."
      },
      {
        "Question": "Explain the rest parameter (...) in ES6.",

    "Questions": [
      {
        "Question": "What is a closure in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "A closure is a function that has access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are created when an inner function is returned or passed as an argument to another function."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is lexical (static) scope in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "Lexical scope, also known as static scope, determines variable accessibility based on where variables are declared in the code. In other words, it's based on the physical location of variables in the source code."
      },
      {
        "Question": "How does a closure work in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "A closure captures and 'remembers' the variables from its outer scope, even when the outer function has finished executing. This allows the inner function to access and manipulate those variables."
      },
      {
        "Question": "Give an example of a closure in JavaScript.",
        "Answer": "```javascript\nfunction outerFunction() {\n  const outerVar = 'I am from outer scope';\n  function innerFunction() {\n    console.log(outerVar); // Accessing outerVar from the outer scope\n  }\n  return innerFunction;\n}\nconst closureExample = outerFunction();\nclosureExample(); // Prints 'I am from outer scope'\n```"
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is variable hoisting in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "Variable hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable declarations (but not initializations) are moved to the top of their containing function or global scope during compilation. This means that you can use a variable before it's declared in your code, but it will be initialized with 'undefined' until the declaration is encountered."
      },
      {
        "Question": "Explain the difference between 'var', 'let', and 'const' variable declarations with respect to scope and hoisting.",
        "Answer": "'var' variables are function-scoped and are hoisted to the top of their function. 'let' and 'const' variables are block-scoped (e.g., within curly braces) and are not hoisted to the top of the block. Additionally, 'const' variables cannot be reassigned after initialization."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is the 'Temporal Dead Zone' (TDZ) in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "The Temporal Dead Zone is the period between entering a scope (e.g., a function or block) and the actual declaration of a variable. During this period, accessing the variable will result in a 'ReferenceError'. This concept applies to 'let' and 'const' variables and is designed to catch potential issues."
      },
      {
        "Question": "How can you prevent variable hoisting issues in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "To prevent variable hoisting issues, it's best practice to declare variables at the top of their containing scope. For 'let' and 'const' variables, it's also important to avoid accessing them before their declaration within the same scope."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is a private variable in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "In JavaScript, private variables are variables that are not directly accessible or modifiable from outside their containing scope. Closures are often used to create private variables and maintain encapsulation."
      },
      {
        "Question": "How can you create a private variable using closures?",
        "Answer": "You can create a private variable by defining it within a closure (an inner function) and not exposing it in the outer scope. The outer function can return the inner function, allowing access to the private variable while preventing direct modification from outside."

      },
      {
        "Question": "How do you create a Promise in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "You can create a Promise using the `Promise` constructor. It takes a callback function with two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`. Example:\n\n```javascript\nconst myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  // Asynchronous code here\n  if (/* Operation successful */) {\n    resolve(result);\n  } else {\n    reject(error);\n  }\n});\n```"

      },
      {
        "Question": "How do you handle errors in a Promise chain?",
        "Answer": "You can use the `.catch()` method at the end of a Promise chain to catch and handle errors that occur in any of the preceding Promises. This allows you to provide a fallback action in case of an error."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is chaining in Promises?",
        "Answer": "Chaining in Promises is a technique where you can attach multiple `.then()` handlers to a Promise. Each `.then()` returns a new Promise, allowing you to perform sequential operations on the resolved values."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is the purpose of async/await in JavaScript?",
        "Answer": "Async/await is a syntax feature in JavaScript that simplifies working with Promises. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous-like manner, making it easier to read and reason about."
      },
      {
        "Question": "How do you define an asynchronous function using async/await?",
        "Answer": "You can define an asynchronous function by prefixing the function declaration or expression with the `async` keyword. For example:\n\n```javascript\nasync function myAsyncFunction() {\n  // Asynchronous code\n  return result;\n}\n```"
      },
      {
        "Question": "How do you use await inside an async function?",
        "Answer": "The `await` keyword is used inside an async function to pause the execution of the function until the awaited Promise is resolved or rejected. It can only be used within an async function."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What happens if a Promise is rejected inside an async function using await?",
        "Answer": "If a Promise is rejected inside an async function using `await`, the function will throw an error. This can be caught using a try-catch block or by using a `.catch()` method on the Promise."
      },
      {
        "Question": "Explain the difference between Promises and callbacks for handling asynchronous code.",
        "Answer": "Callbacks are a traditional way of handling asynchronous code, while Promises provide a more structured and readable approach. Promises offer better error handling and allow you to avoid callback hell (nested callbacks)."

      {
        "Question": "What is a stack and how does it work?",
        "Answer": "A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It allows elements to be pushed onto the top and popped off from the top. Stacks are often used for managing function calls and undo operations."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is a queue and how does it work?",
        "Answer": "A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue). Queues are commonly used for task scheduling and breadth-first search algorithms."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is a sorting algorithm, and what are some common sorting algorithms?",
        "Answer": "A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that arranges elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Common sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is a searching algorithm, and what are some common searching algorithms?",
        "Answer": "A searching algorithm is an algorithm used to find the location or presence of a specific element in a collection of data. Common searching algorithms include Linear Search, Binary Search, and Hashing."
      },
      {
        "Question": "What is time complexity and space complexity in algorithm analysis?",
        "Answer": "Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run based on the size of its input. Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses. Big O notation is often used to express time and space complexity."
      },
      {
        "Question": "When would you use an array over a linked list, and vice versa?",
        "Answer": "You would use an array when you need fast random access to elements and the size of the collection is fixed or known in advance. You would use a linked list when you need dynamic resizing or frequent insertions and deletions."
